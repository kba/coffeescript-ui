//select should look like a button, so no scss is needed!? , need to be specific cause the opened menu has a cui-button-select
.cui-select > .cui-button-select {
    width: 100%; //behave like every other data-field-input , size is set on container

    > .cui-button-center {
        text-align: left;
    }
}
